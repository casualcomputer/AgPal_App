# AgPal_App

**This colab notebook shows the stuff I tried so far**: http://bit.ly/3FgL8qJ

This Streamlit app for AgPal:
* Shows the results of our semantic search 
* Shows the results of the AgPal searcch
* Allows users to identify and report bad matches by indices
  * Based on user input, prints out performance comparison
  * Stores user feedback into an Excel sheet (search log): https://bit.ly/3W3Yyh7
  
Features/Improvements in-process:
* Refine text preprocessing 
* Modifying the user feedback mechanism, allowing performance data to be recorded
* Adding more models to the interface
* Fine tuning models for semantic search, lexical search; define ranking function
* Making codes cleaner, making app faster

Note, for the Google Drive feature to work, you need to copy and paste the credential file (agpal_plus_8d2114c78f0a.json) to your project directory.
